rough-collapse
==============

Component for easy collapsibles/accordions.
The CSS is divided into necessary and "makeup" styles.

## Roadmap
Scratch the javascript I've written and find someone who's done it better. Look here for inspiration:

- http://jqueryui.com/accordion
- https://github.com/jgorset/jquery-collapsible
